    'Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

    '- The ticker symbol
    '- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    '- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    '- The total stock volume of the stock

    'You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
